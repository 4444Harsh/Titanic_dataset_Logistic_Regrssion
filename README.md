# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Model Submission

This repository contains the notebook and submission files for the Titanic Kaggle competition.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. The notebook uses the provided training data to build a predictive model, which is then used to generate predictions on the test data.

## Files

- **train.csv**: The training dataset containing features of passengers along with the target variable (`Survived`).
- **test.csv**: The test dataset used for generating predictions.
- **Untitled4.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook that contains the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction generation.
- **submission.csv**: The output file that contains the `PassengerId` and the predicted `Survived` values, formatted for submission to Kaggle.

## Notebook Overview

### Data Preprocessing

The notebook begins by loading the training and test datasets. It handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

### Model Training

A machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed training data. The model chosen may vary, such as a Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or another classifier, based on performance metrics evaluated during cross-validation.

### Prediction

The model is then used to predict the `Survived` values for the passengers in the test dataset. These predictions are combined with the `PassengerId` from the test data to create a submission file.

### Submission

The generated predictions are saved in a file called `submission.csv`, ready to be uploaded to the Kaggle competition.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (e.g., using `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Open `titanic_dataset.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the model, and generate the submission file.
5. The `submission.csv` file will be created in the same directory, ready to be submitted to Kaggle.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic approach to the Titanic survival prediction problem using machine learning. Further improvements could include feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and testing different models to improve accuracy.
